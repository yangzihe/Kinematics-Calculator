Kinematics-Calculator
=====================

Web app calculator written in Python that solves kinematics problems often found in introductory physics classes. Only works with the assumption that acceleration is uniform. The calculator takes in values for the acceleration, displacement, initial velocity, current velocity, and elapsed time variables. In kinematics this type of kinematic equation, one variable is not considered at all. Given values to the other four variables, the calculator uses SymPy functions to solve for the last variable. Finals values are rounded to the thousandths place.

**Note:** When prompted for the value of the variable _x_  please enter the displacement, or _Î”x_ or _x-x<sub>0</sub>_ and not the current and/or initial position of the object .

Future improvements include:
* Refactor code to make it more Object Oriented
* Optimizing current code
* Adding natural language processing functionality
* Adding functions to solve other types of calculation-intensive physics problems
